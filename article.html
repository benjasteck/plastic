                <p>Trillions of pieces of plastic pollute our oceans today, and the problem is worsening. This plastic has a devastating impact on marine wildlife and ecosystems. Plastics can persist for many decades, continuously degrading into microplastics. These can be ingested by wildlife and later enter the human food chain. Plastic pollution is a global crisis requiring urgent action.

                <p>Globally, only 9% of plastic gets recycled. Even in developed countries, the recycling rate for plastics collected by households is often far less than 50%, with very little of that converted back into packaging. Most “‘recycled”’ packaging waste is downcycled into lower value or unrecycable products, meaning that the process is only delaying the plastic’s inevitable journey to the landfill.

            <p class="sub2">Recent evidence indicates that humans constantly inhale and ingest microplastic through contaminated seafood, including fish and shellfish, Additionally, microplastics have been found in tap water, bottled water, and even commonly consumed beverages, such as beer and salt. In fact, a new study estimates that the average adult consumes approximately 2,000 microplastics per year through salt.

                    <p>Studies have shown microplastics significantly damage cells in the human body, leading to serious health effects, including cancers, lung disease, and birth defects. Not only this, but toxic chemical additives in plastics can alter hormone activity in the human body which disrupts reproduction, growth and cognitive function. Microplastics also act as vessels for pathogens to enter the human body which increases the spread of disease.</p>

                    <p>Children and infants in the womb are most vulnerable to the harmful effects of plastics due to the early stages of human development being particularly sensitive to hazardous chemicals in the environment. Exposure to plastics has been found to increase the risks of birth complications, lung growth and childhood cancer. Crucially, this means plastic pollution will continue to wreak havoc on our lives and earth for generations to come.</p>

            <h3 class="endTitle">How you can help combat it</h2>
            <ul class="endList">
                <li> Tiny plastic particles, called “microbeads,” have become a growing source of ocean plastic pollution in recent years. Microbeads are found in some face scrubs, toothpastes, and bodywashes, and they readily enter our oceans and waterways through our sewer systems, and affect hundreds of marine species. Avoid products containing plastic microbeads by looking for “polythelene” and “polypropylene” on the ingredient labels of your cosmetic products.</li>
                <!-- https://www.oceanicsociety.org/resources/7-ways-to-reduce-ocean-plastic-pollution-today/ -->
                <li>In England, single-use plastic plates and cutlery are set to be banned (The Guardian). We use an estimated 4.25 billion pieces of disposable cutlery every year (Defra). By carrying a spork, a spare fork from home, or your own mini-reusable set including reusable straw, you can help cut down on disposables which would have turned into ocean pollution. Where possible, avoid straws completely, even if they’re made from paper, as this reduces the need for resources to produce and dispose of them.</li>
           <!-- https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/top-tips-reduce-your-plastic-footprint -->

            </ul>
            <p class="finish">
                Going plastic-free has its positives and negatives. Plastic weighs less than glass so can reduce transport emissions, but glass is more widely recycled and contains a higher portion of recycled content which can reduce its impact on resource consumption globally. If removing plastic from your life completely is unfeasible, make your plastic containers go further. For example, when a plastic bottle finishes, try your local refill shop and fill those containers with new products including wet and dry goods. We can also reuse containers like old butter and ice cream tubs as sandwich boxes, useful tubs for screws or nails, or planters for seedlings.</p>
